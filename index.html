    <p>My Dear Love,</p>
    <p> 
        Today is a super-duper special day because it's your birthday! Imagine the sun waking up and saying, "Yay, Sakshi is having a birthday! My heart is jumping with happiness like a bouncy ball because you make my life extra bright".
        <br><br>
        When we first met, my world became like a magical garden full of beautiful flowers that never stop blooming. Your smile is like sunshine in the morning, and it paints happy colors on the inside of my heart. And when you laugh, it's like the most wonderful song that makes my heart dance with joy. Your heart is like a cozy hug full of kindness and love. It's my special place where I feel really safe and happy. We've had lots of memories together, and each one is like a big hug from you. You're really good at being a great girlfriend with your kind words and loving actions. We're like characters in a cool story that goes on exciting journeys together.
        <br><br>
        Today, on your birthday, I want you to know that you're super important to me. Your dreams are like my dreams, and when you do something awesome, it feels like a victory for both of us. You're strong and beautiful, inside and out. I feel amazed by you every day, and I'm lucky to be your partner.
        <br><br>
        Sakshi, you're like the North Star that helps me find my way when things seem dark. Your voice is like a sweet song that makes me feel calm and happy. And the love I have for you is like a big, warm hug that makes everything feel just right. I'm so excited for making more fun memories together, like painting colorful pictures of our dreams.
        <br><br>
        I hope your birthday is as bright as your smile, as magical as fairy tales, and as cozy as a big hug. Cheers to us and all the wonderful days we'll have together, just like watching the sun come up.
        <br><br>
        Happy Birthday my love! You'll always be in my heart.
        <br><br>
        With lots and lots of love,
        <br>
        Ritish
